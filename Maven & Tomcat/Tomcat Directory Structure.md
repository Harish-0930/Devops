# Apache Tomcat – Directory Structure & Explanation

## Directory Structure
```
bin/        – Startup & shutdown scripts
conf/       – Main configuration files
lib/        – Core Tomcat libraries
logs/       – Log files generated by Tomcat
temp/       – Temporary runtime files
webapps/    – Deployed applications (WARs & exploded folders)
work/       – Compiled JSPs and servlet runtime files
```

## One-line purpose for each folder
- `bin/` – Scripts to start/stop Tomcat (startup.sh, shutdown.sh, catalina.sh).
- `conf/` – Main configuration files (server.xml, web.xml, tomcat-users.xml).
- `lib/` – Core Tomcat Java libraries (.jar).
- `logs/` – Catalina, localhost, manager and host-manager logs.
- `temp/` – Temporary files used at runtime.
- `webapps/` – Deployed applications (ROOT, manager, host-manager, your WARs).
- `work/` – Compiled JSPs and runtime temporary files.

## Docker Structure (common volume mount)
```
/usr/local/tomcat/
├── bin/
├── conf/
├── lib/
├── logs/
├── webapps/
├── webapps.dist/
└── temp/
```
